# Hy-Qt5-Examples
PyQt5 examples translated into Hy

Hy is a Python-compatible language with a Lisp-like syntax. This repository
contains some of the PyQt5 examples that have been translated to Hy.

Note that this uses the current stable version of Hy. The dev version has
an improved `(defclass)` syntax that isn't used here.
